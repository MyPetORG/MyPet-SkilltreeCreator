  routes.tsx â€” Placeholder for future route-based code splitting.

  The application currently renders a single App shell under a HashRouter. If
  we later introduce multiple pages (e.g., settings/about), this module can
  export route objects or lazy components. Keeping this file documented avoids
  confusion when discovered by readers/tools.
